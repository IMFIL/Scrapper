                    <p>Welcome to Scrapper, with this tool there will be no more need to make scripts to scrape websites. It is as easy at it can be, if you desire to use the API you will have to input the URL of the website as the first parameter and then all the the needed tags as subsequent query parameters. This will return a JSON file which can easily be read by any modern language. Now if you dont want to mess with any code,  you can simply input the web adress in the search bar, select the tags you need and it will give you the the values of those tags. </p>
